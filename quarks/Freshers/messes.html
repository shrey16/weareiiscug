				IISc has four messes - A, B, C, and D - each catering to a different set of food preferences:
				</p>
				<table class="table table-hover table-responsive table-striped">
					<tr>
						<th> Cuisine </th>
						<th> Pure vegetarian </th>
						<th> Non-vegetarian </th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th> North indian </th>
						<td> D </td>
						<td> B </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th> South indian </th>
						<td> A </td>
						<td> C </td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
				A and B Mess are located somewhat far away from the UG buildings - walkable certainly, but it’s far more convenient to reach them on a bicycle to save time for gobbling up delicious food! C and D Mess are located very near the UG Buildings (just outside the New Boys’ Hostel and the New Girls’ Hostel), where freshers will have their classes for the first year.
				</p>
				<p>
				The pure vegetarian messes are exactly what they sound like, while the non-vegetarian messes allow you to register both as a Non-Veg member (you’ll get the non-veg items as part of your daily meals) or as a Veg member (you’ll only get veg items normally, but if you want non-veg items, you can ask for them, and the price will be added to your monthly mess bill separately). Extra non-veg items or eggs can be ordered separately, and will be added to your mess bill accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
				The mess timings are given below:
				</p>
				<table class="table table-hover table-responsive table-striped">
					<tr>
						<th> Meal </th>
						<th> Timings </th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> Breakfast </td>
						<td> 07:30 to 09:45 </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> Lunch </td>
						<td>12:30 to 14:00</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td> Snacks </td>
						<td>16:30 to 18:00</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Dinner</td>
						<td>19:30 to 21:00</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
				These timings are for entry, so if you enter the mess at 13:59, you’ll get your lunch, but not all items may be available. I recommend you enter the mess well before the closing time to have a sufficiently relaxed lunch with your friends. Also, the messes are pretty strict about no late entry, so avoid that. When you enter the mess, you will have to scan your ID card before getting your meal, so make sure you have it with you all the time (on some occasions, if you forget, they’ll let you in if you give them your SR number). 
				</p>
				<p>
				In the event that you take a holiday, you can “Sign Out” of the mess and you won’t be billed for the period until you again “Sign In” to the mess (this period has to be at least two days long, though). Mess and hostel bills are paid together, and in general automatically deducted from your bank account. To get details of the transaction, you can visit the Finance department.
				</p>
				<p>
				In my experience over one year here, the messes offer a very healthy balanced diet without compromising on taste or quality. Different varieties of food are offered, and the menu changes every so often to offer fresh choices. Regular pest control work is carried out to ensure hygienic conditions of food preparation.
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t worry too much about choosing the “right” mess now: despite strong opinions on the messes that your seniors will express, different messes will suit people with different tastes. Of course, you always have the opportunity of switching messes every two months (again subject to availability). So, explore the variety of cuisines offered at IISc’s messes, and pick your favourite!
				</p>
				<p>
				Here are some reviews by our students for each of the messes at IISc. Of course, take them with a pinch of salt… or pepper.
				</p>
<div class="subsection">
<p> <h1>A Mess (by P Vasanth)</h1> </p>
<p>
A Mess is the south Indian vegetarian mess of IISc. This is the right mess for south Indians looking for a homecooked meal, and for anyone really looking for that nice south indian flavour. The breakfasts usually include idli, vada, dosa, poha, pongal, kesari bath and bisibelebath, distributed over the week. The snacks are popular items like dal vada, madduru vada, bonda, mirchi bajji and dahi vada, as well as some standards like bhel puri, pani puri and so on. </p>
<p>
The standard or base menu at lunch and dinner is what is popularly called RRBM – Rice, Rasam, Buttermilk. In addition they usually serve chapathis and a curry. However, this is but the base upon which to get creative, and creative it has been. The main attraction of A Mess, apart from the beloved breakfasts would be its willingness to try new items. The mess has given me an amazing culinary experience over the past year with foods ranging from tomato soup, grape juice, ragi malt and lime juice, to puliyogare, pulav and even aloo paratha.</p>
<p>
The main drawback of the mess, I believe, is that it is situated further from the UG buildings than the C and D Messes. However, I would say the pros outweigh the cons and overall, it is a great mess and is worth joining.</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<p><h1>B Mess (by Anirban Mandal)</p></h1>
<p>
B mess is popularly known as the Bengali mess. I can say that food here is very home like. Non-veg is well cooked and if you are not in mood for that, you can opt for good old dal chawal. Fish curry is also served, which i must say has its own class of fans. You can ask for onions and chillies freely. For snacks there is often muri chanachur (puffed rice), a Bengali feature to be highlighted. Also, there often is sukto for lunch, which is a mixed vegetable preparation with data (drumsticks) and with a touch of mustard flavour.
 </p>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<p><h1>C Mess (by Thanmay Menon) </p></h1>
<p>C Mess (the south Indian veg and non-veg mess) is the most populous of all four messes. Its proximity to E block (first year UG boys hostel) certainly helps in its popularity A large proportion of its members are south Indians (obviously) but it has a very significant proportion of North Indians too. This very fact should testify to its glory in comparison to other messes here. I am not kidding: we have people here who have been members of all 4 messes and they agree wholeheartedly. After all, it’s the only mess (until now)  to offer pastries and donuts as evening snacks every week. C mess also has the largest proportion of the 2016 UG batch (not sure if that’s a matter of concern though). </p>
<p>
Non-veg members get chicken (either as curry or fry) on all days except on Tuesday and Wednesday. On these two days, we get fish and mutton respectively. Eggs are available on all days. For Keralites, Kerala rice is available here on all weekdays and it’s pretty good too - I know what good Kerala rice is, I’m a Mallu! Immigrants from other messes tell me that food here is a little spicier than at other North Indian messes. Shouldn’t be a problem,though.</p>
<p>

All messes have their bad days. For C mess, in my opinion, these fall (fortunately) on the weekends, especially the Sunday dinner. Ugh! As it’s a weekend, it is easier to go and have food outside. Or you can have it delivered to your room, of course.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<p><h1>D Mess (by Shabarish CH) </p></h1>
<p>D Mess serves north Indian vegetarian food. Dal, rotis and rice (as much as you want!) are available every day for lunch and dinner. Sabzi is also available with every meal. Sabzi is prepared in north Indian style (the north Indian part about this mess). There is salad every day during lunch. Curd is available during lunchtime and buttermilk for dinner. Sweets like kheer are prepared on some days for dinner. </p>
<p>
The menu is fixed by the mess committee and changed once every few months to break the monotony. For breakfast, on some days there is paratha, dosa on some days, idli, pongal, poori-chana, etc. For snacks, there are items like samosa, pani puri, vegetable cutlet, pav bhaji, poha, etc. Coffee, milk and tea are available during breakfast and snacks. Sunday lunch includes ice cream, and a different flavour is served each week.</p>
