<p><h1>

What is Pravega?</h1></p>
<p>
Pravega is the annual science, tech and cultural festival of IISc Bangalore. “Pravega” is the Sanskrit word

for “Acceleration” - the derivative of velocity. Organized mainly by the undergrads, Pravega is pretty young

as compared to its fellow college fests of other nationally acclaimed Institutes. In its fifth edition, Pravega

is about to make you witness the most awaited fiesta, taking you on a 3-days’ cruise to the carnival of

passion away from the long hectic year. Pravega is generally organized in the month of January. The year

2017 saw it happen on 20th, 21st & 22nd of January.</p>
<p><h1>
Why celebrate and contribute for a College Festival?</p></h1>
<p>

A college festival helps in bringing together several institutions from across the country. They hugely

promote innovative ideas and provide students the scope to share their knowledge and ideas with others.

Nonetheless, it helps in improving skills, like those in planning, management, pressure handling,

communication, etc. Moreover, one gets to be a part of plenty workshops, events, quizzes, and cultural

events. A festival is more appropriately meant to serve the purpose of being a hiatus from the hectic daily

life of an undergrad student.</p>
<p><h1>

Purpose of Pravega...
</p></h1>
<p>
We aren’t getting any younger now, are we? Enjoy life while you can. Each day would teach new lessons

and these lessons would improve the pre-existing skills one already has got. The objective of Pravega is

to nurture young minds to make them competent for this modern-day world which is no less exclusive of

Science. This serves the purpose of teaching scientific minds in blending science with culture.

Early Preparations and Introduction to the division of Labour...
</p>
<p>
The team would comprise of Core Coordinators, Event/Workshop Coordinators, Team Members and

volunteers. The Chief, Technical, Outreach, Cultural, Finance, Design and Publicity Coordinators form the

core team. The Core team members further select subject(s), event(s), quiz(zes) and workshop(s)

coordinators, and subsequently they form their own teams by gathering interested folks, in their respective

teams. The preparations, discussions and planning by each team starts off right from the month of

August, or as early as possible.</p>
<p>

Effective planning, coordination and proper time utilization by the members prevent mayhem in the crucial

days. Pravega could never happen if the whole UG community didn’t participate. So, a joint effort, proper

management and commitment from the members would make our fest a success.

Publicizing our fest is our top priority, and the Publicity Team takes care of it. Yet, the whole community

gears up to publicize the events via all possible sources of communication and social media.

The major financial support is provided by the sponsors. The Outreach Team is meant for getting sponsors

and works in liaison with them. In order to maximize the financial support, cool merchandise is also


designed by our esteemed design team, and those are sold off before, while and after the fest within the

institute.</p>
<p>

The Design team is assigned to make posters for significant days of every month (festivals, birthdays of

persons of interest, days of significant causes, etc.), and are supposed to put them up online. It also

designs the merchandise, banners, flexes, etc. and functions as one of the most essential teams, in letting

the festival happen. This team provides a huge scope to let the hidden talents out.</p>
<p>

The Technical Coordinator, and Chief Coordinator coordinate, assist and advice all the other coordinators

of the core team and event coordinators as well.</p>

<p><h1>Events
</p></h1>
The most popular Science events are listed as follows:
<ul>

<li> The Auction – An event organized by the Math geeks

<li> Armchair Physicist – An event organized by the Physics nerds

<li> Molecular Murals – An event organized by the Chem adepts

<li> Whoddunit – An event organized by the Bio crammers
</ul>
The most tempting of all are undeniably the Cultural events. The significant ones are:
<ul>

<li> Battle of the Bands – A nationwide competition, for semi-pro bands.

<li> Lasya – A nationwide dancing competition.

<li> Proscenium – A nationwide competition in theatrical performances.

<li> Pro-nites – The evenings and nights are accompanied by the entertaining acts by nationally

acclaimed professional entertainers (musicians, comedians, dancers, etc.). Pronites are

considered to be the main source of attraction for people outside the institute.
</ul>

<p><h1>The week before Pravega...</p></h1>

<p>1 or 2 weeks to Pravega could be considered as the time of paramount importance. Coordinators and

team members spend long hours, yet enthusiastically and with patience. This is the time which requires

the utmost assistance by people from across the whole community. Publicity gets maximized big time and

even flash mobs/publicity stunts are performed at reputed places and colleges in and around Bangalore to

reach out to larger masses. Auditoriums, Halls, etc., which are meant to be venues to different events, are

taken care of. Last minute modifications in designs, event planning, etc. are discussed and the needful are

decided as per convenience. Banners, posters, flexes are put up at suitable places across the Institute, for

the purpose of guiding the expected visitors, and people who are unaware of the events.</p>

<p><h1>The Most Awaited 3 Days...</p></h1>

Let the story remain untold (:

<p>Reward for your contribution: A cool volunteer T-shirt, with logos of IISc and Pravega on it.</p>
