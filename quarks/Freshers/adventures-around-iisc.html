<p>Hello juniors, first of all, my heartiest congratulations on your admission into one of the most prestigious

institutes in India. In the following four or five years you will get to know the real challenges of studying in

IISc. Mark my words, it’s not going to be easy, but it will make you capable. Going through this hard time,

you will need good friends and some hobbies. For me, its travelling and adventure. When I get bored of

the tedious and repetitious coursework, or feeling down; I turn myself in to this hobby of mine, and it gives

me peace of mind. It’s not like we plan everything out; believe me, in college life, the most planned trips

are most likely not to occur.</p>
<p>

I also expect some of you to be nature-lovers, travellers, and adventurers. So, here are some places you

can visit in around 12 hours time in and around Bangalore to quench your wanderlust a little.
</p><p>
I went to these places by bike on weekend or holiday nights. But there are other means of travel like

renting a self-drive car (eg. Zoomcar) or bike (eg. Wheelstreet) or cycling or public transportation etc.
</p>
<h1>Nandi hills (Distance: 58km)</h1>

<p>This is the nearest and most popular out-of-the-city tourist spot you can visit, I guess all IIScians have

been there at least once. Going to this place is easy and comfortable, it’s good to start with. If you reach

there early in the morning, you will be able to see clouds passing by, the cold wind and gentle rays of

rising sun comforting you. From the top everything looks like it belongs to a miniature toy park. Maybe

that’s why Tipu sultan built a summer palace there, which you can still see, at least whatever is left of it.

When you come down from the hill, you must try the roadside food.</p>

<h1>Avalabetta (Distance: 90km)</h1>

<p>After visiting Nandi hills if you want to go a little further and to a place less popular, Avalabetta should be

on your list. As the place is not visited often, roads are not well maintained. You have to go on a 10km

dusty road in between forest, far from the nearest village. Riding through this place for the first time, at

midnight chilled me to the core. Do not trust Google Maps blindly at this point. Do stop on this road, and

you will be able to hear the pleasing sounds of insects and alarming howling, roaring of animals. Then as

you look up and find a clear sky full of stars, you’ll want to leave everything and keep gazing forever. All

these things give you an adrenaline rush and a sense of freedom for the first time which is too hard to turn

down. Then you just feel the irresistible urge to go on this kind of adventures.</p>
<p>

When you reach at the gate at around 4 am, there may be some vendors selling tea, coffee and different

varieties of hot fries which is just perfect. Then you wait for some time staring at the sky or chatting with

you friends or with the few people who went there from Bangalore to seek similar adventures like you.

Now you have to make a brave decision, if you want to see the sunrise. The gate will be closed and there

will be no one inside, you will have to make your way pass that closed gate and walk to the top in the

dark. The view of the sunrise is going to be phenomenal. If you can gather some courage, luck and finish

this trip, it will be like no other.</p>


<h1>Madhugiri Fort (Distance: 97km)</h1>
<p>

This is going to be a hard trek, so prepare yourself for almost two hours of steep, tiring trek. If you leave

IISc at 3 am, you will reach there around 5 am. Have some biscuit and the awesome coffee at the stall

near the bus stand, then start your trek. At first there will be stairs and railing but as you go up it will be

harder and harder, and you will find yourself trekking very steep rocks without any support. However,

exhausting the trek is, when you reach the top finally all of your efforts will be rewarded. The surrounding

is so peaceful and relaxing you will just forget about everything. Just sit the on the walls on the side walls,

feel the pleasing wind and enjoy the view of the town nearby and the other hills. I am sure you will lose

track of time.</p>

<h1>Savandurga (Distance: 63km)</h1>

<p>This is a place where you will find no restriction to climb the hill unlike the other three. You start your trip at

1am you will reach there by 3am. After taking some rest you climb up on the hill and sit at the top to enjoy

the awesome view of the towns nearby and the other hills. The sky will be full of stars and if you go there

on a full moon day, the experience gets even better. The sun rises from in between two hills far away.

When you descend, some stalls will be open, where you can have some coffee and start your return

journey.</p>

<h1>Rasta Café (Distance: 47km)</h1>

<p>Sometimes you just feel like going on a bike ride at night without any tiring trek or spending a lot of time.

The way to Rasta café is one of the nicest night bike ride I had. While riding on the four lane Outer Ring

road with very little traffic, you will be able to see the horizon kissed by the city lights, while the lights of

the industrial buildings decorate the rest of your visor. The food, and the ambience is decent there. The

place will be open till 4am, and you can come back by 5am.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other places you can explore depending on availability of your time. I just wanted to give

you all a feel of travelling; What I just wrote is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
