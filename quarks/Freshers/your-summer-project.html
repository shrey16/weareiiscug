<h1>Why do a summer project?</h1>
<p>

First of all, welcome to IISc. I’m sure by now you would have heard lectures by the deans as to how IISc is

one of the top colleges, you are the cream of the country’s students, etc etc; so I’ll get straight to the

point. By now you all of you have heard about the summer projects that most UG students at IISc do over

the summer, either because you are a KVPY scholar or follow the UG aspirants page on FB. Most of you

would be wondering as to why doing a summer project is such a biggie, other than to renew your

scholarship for the next year. I too thought so when I first came here. However interacting with my

classmates and teachers helped me realise why this is so important.</p>
<p>

Summer projects are our chance to do/learn something that we have always wanted to but never had the

time/guidance to. Face it, a three month vacation is too long and doing something worthwhile in this time

is much better than getting bored. And in addition to learning something new, you get to do it with

someone with lots of experience and expertise in that topic; interacting with some of the best researchers

in the country does give you a lot of experience in tackling the problems in the field you choose. It is also

a great way to keep up with the current research in the field you are working on.</p>
<p>

And for those of us looking at research careers, it gives us a slight taste at what its like to become a

research scientist in our field.</p>
<p>

Another great reason to do summer projects is to get recommendations. Recommendations from senior

professors are highly valued and of great help in getting into that dream university for your Ph.D or getting

an internship at that foreign university you always wanted. With the competition to get into the best

universities in the world, a great recommendation can go a long way in helping you achieve that dream.

Even if you want to get a job after graduation, professors often have lots of contacts in the industry and a

word in your favour from a highly respected prof can do wonders for your job prospects.</p>
<p><h1>

How to select a summer project?</p></h1>

<p>Selecting a summer project depends on which year you are currently in. When coming to IISc, most of us

(sort of) have an idea as to which subjects excite us more than others. In the course of your first year, you

may start liking perhaps a subject or two more. The first summer is to find out which ‘major subject’ you

like as it would help you immensely in choosing your major at the end of your 3rd sem. For instance, when

I came to IISc, physics and environmental science were my favourite subjects. After my first year here, I

also developed an interest in biology after not taking it in my +2. Hence in my first summer (at end of my

1st year), I did an experimental summer project in biology. I didn’t like it that much and this helped me to

choose physics as my major. If you are already sure about your interests, you can use the summer to

choose between the experimental and theoretical side of the subject (except math that is). You might be

more inclined towards one rather than the other but it is often a good idea to explore both...you might end

up liking it.</p>
<p>

In their second summer, people most often choose a project in a topic which interests them, usually in

their major subject but occasionally an interdisciplinary topic. This helps to find it if the topic you like is

actually interests you enough to pursue in the future.</p>
<p>

Beyond the second summer the kind of projects people choose depends on their aims. Some go for a

foreign internship for exposure and a better CV. Others might choose to stay and work on something of

their interest, especially if they can a paper published on it. You would anyway get to know about this in

IISc, so just relax and try and enjoy your first year.</p>


<p><h1>Sending a mail to the professor.</h1></p>
<p>

Sending a mail to the professor you want to work under is obviously the most important part. Once you

have identified what you want to work on, go to the department websites and find professors who work

on similar topics. Since you are in your first year, some of the senior professors might tell you to try again

next summer; it is normal and you don’t have to feel disappointed. The important thing is not to rest till

you find a professor. Start the search for a professor around October, just after the midsems of your

autumn semester is recommended, so that you can get to work under your preferred professor in the topic

of your choice.</p>
<p>

Writing a mail to the professor depends on how you want to do it. Some people prefer to mass mail 5-10

professors at once and hope for a reply from one of them. Others prefer to go through the work of a

professor first and then send personalised mails. This obviously involves more time and effort but a

professor is also more likely to respond to someone who is more interested in his work. They have been

around for a long time, they can easily recognise a mass-mailed summer project request when they see

one.</p>
<p>
Well, these are some basic points as to why you would do a summer project and how to go about it. This

is not a comprehensive guide and talking to your seniors will be a lot more helpful than this hastily written

guide. Anyway, I hope this is a decent starting point in your search for a summer project. And whatever

you do, remember to always have fun.</p>

<p>Once again welcome to IISc and have a great year ahead! :D</p>
