<p>IISc’s undergraduate program is one of the newest, or youngest if you will, undergraduate science

programs in the country. This year, the seventh batch of the program will be joining the institution and

joining a hundred year long tradition of research and learning. And with the semester approaching and the

pressure mounting, most of the new students will turn to platforms such as Facebook, Quora, etc., to get

some insight into life at IISc, and how to prepare for it. I myself attempted to learn about this in a similar

manner. As it turned out, I didn’t really learn much for all the time I spent online. And this year, once again,

I see a bunch of nervous (and some not so nervous) juniors asking the same questions that I did, “How do

I prepare for the course?”, “Will it be difficult?”, and the more general, “What is life like at IISc?”. So, here

is a personal and biased answer to some such questions.</p>
<p>
The first semester here is one of the best and most memorable semesters at IISc UG. This might not

sound like much coming from one who has experienced only two semesters, but it is indeed fun. And I

can undoubtedly give credit to my classmates and seniors for making it this memorable. Our seniors were

always quite nice to us and in the first week here, they showed us around, introduced us to the campus,

and made us feel at home. Personally, I was quite apprehensive about talking to people, afraid to

approach them, but I was able to make friends and fit into my own small social niche. And at the end of

one month here, I was quite at home. And one thing that I definitely found, indeed still find, excellent here,

is my peer group. I could not have asked for a more diverse group of classmates. The quality of

conversation and the passion for a subject is really great here (except of course after those tiring days

which make you question the meaning of life and other things). One nice thing is that you always find

someone who likes the same things as you. My ‘someone’s, the ones I found, have motivated me to do

my best in all my courses, and all my hobbies.</p>

<p>Then no doubt comes the classes themselves. During the first week of here, I was very apprehensive

about attending the classes. I had little or no background in computer science and was not really great at

any other subject either. But the first week of classes calmed me down. There was one thing a senior told

me that really explain the transition I had in the first week. He told me that those who taught the first

semester courses would be some of the best professors and best researchers in IISc. The UG program

wants to inspire us and what better way to do so then to get highly qualified teachers to teach us the

subject, the right way. And I definitely enjoyed it. The professors took their time to help us understand the

subject and get used to both the language and the notation. For all my insecurities, I never felt

overwhelmed, and was able to keep pace with the class. Indeed I wanted to keep pace for each class was

one to look forward to. And of course, slowly the classes sped up and got very interesting. And

surprisingly, I was able to keep up without too much trouble, and was able to do well. And the labs weren’t

lagging behind either. It was a wonderful experience to work in the labs There were some moments, some

experiments, which were not in the same spirit of adventure or discovery as the rest (which left them open

to considerable mocking by us), however, on the whole the course was well structured and well balanced.

</p><p>Then of course I should come to everyone’s favourite, hobbies. A big worry among prospective or new

students is that you won’t have enough time to pursue any hobby or sport. That is one thing that should

not worry you (there are others, but I probably shouldn’t mentions them in an article meant to motivate

you). I personally play fairly regularly. I play badminton or table tennis, and on occasion, even football. I

also read books, though not as much as some, listen to music, though not as much as some, and play

the guitar, though not as well as some (funny how these phrases get old so quickly). I definitely found time

to do all of this around studying, and completing lab reports and assignments. And of course there was

time for chatting in the corridor, a most addictive pass time that nearly everyone indulges in (though

probably not all at the same time judging by the size of the corridors). Really, everyone here has a hobby.

There are sports freaks who have to exercise for a few hours everyday, and nature freaks who have to take

walks for a few hours everyday. There are gamers who sometimes spend the whole day, except for

classes, gaming, and occasionally there are gamers who spend the whole day, including classes, gaming.

There are musicians, even those who perform multiple times a year as part of the music club, and actors

who are naturally in the drama club. And so, for those who don’t procrastinate over their work too much,

there is always time for a hobby (and the other category can always consider procrastination their hobby).

And so, if I haven’t made it amply clear, don’t worry, your time at IISc won’t be spent exclusively on

turning you into a study freak, for lack of a better phrase.</p>

<p>And so, I will stop here holding on to the hope that I have said enough to put your fears to rest. I think it is

only right that I give you a fighting chance to discover, at least some of the joys and experiences yourself.

And since no article is complete without a cliche ending, all the best for your first semester at IISc.</p>
