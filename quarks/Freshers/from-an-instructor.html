				<p>Dear students,</p>

<p>I am asked to write something that, from a teacher’s point of view, is important for the new undergrads

coming to IISc to consider. The first semester can get very busy very fast. Apart for new classes and

studies, there will be new classmates, seniors...new activities and attractions. Let me try to make a list of

things for you to ponder and tick:</p>

<p><h1>1. First things first: Get the formalities done and out of your way.</h1></p>
<p>

You will have a little time as soon as you join and before things get crazy. Take care of the

formalities regarding course registrations, hostel-room registration and mess memberships. These

are necessary evils that must be tackled, and no point putting them off. Make sure you have a

handy bank with an account. Figure out details of immediate expenditures: hostel, mess, transport

(if you get a cycle) and more. Many of you will have some fellowship. Plan a little about how much

money you have and how you need to survive.</p>

<p>Remember, you have taken the first step toward independence. It comes with a huge

responsibility. Money coming from family should now be considered a bonus.</p>

<p><h1>2. Take care of your body: Eat well, sleep well, keep clean, exercise.</h1></p>

<p>Again, with independence comes responsibility. Your first responsibility is to yourself. Now, in the

hostel, there is no adult to give you breakfast and tell you to go have a bath. Nobody will wash

your clothes and clean your room. The only way you will be able to enjoy this time as a young

adult is if you are healthy.
</p>
<p>Eat regularly.... eat properly. Remember, classes start early... always keep some food in the room

in case you are left with no time for breakfast. And no, chips and soft-drinks are not enough in the

long run.</p>

<p>Have a bath regularly... personal hygiene is essential. Unwashed bodies and unwashed clothes

stink up the area around you... and everybody notices: your classmates AND your teachers.</p>

<p>Figure out how much sleep is necessary for you to function well. It must accommodate your play

time as well as work. A major reason for not being able to follow things in a classroom is that you

are drowsy and unable to focus. A major reason for feeling low is that you are tired and can’t bring

yourself to take interest in what’s going on around you. So, sleep. In your room, in your bed. Not in

the classroom with the bench as your pillow.
</p>
<p>Exercise...physical and mental... very important. Did you not do it in your 11th and 12th? Now is

the time to correct that. IISc has good facilities for gym, sports, cycling, swimming. Find like-
minded people and go use those.</p>

<p><h1>3. Take care of your mind: Keep your chin up. Make sure you are happy.
</h1></p>
<p>As I said before, you are your first responsibility. I am sure the last two years were tough for most

of you. You probably had no time for yourself. There were probably pressures from all

quarters.Unfortunately, I can’t promise that it is over. BUT.... Now that you are on way to being on

your own, the one thing that you can make your priority is to take control of how things affect you.
</p>

<p>
Often, as a part of being away from home for the first time, some of you may experience

homesickness. Loneliness. As a part of being in a premier institute, some of you may find that you

are not the esteemed topper in the class any more. You will be surrounded by brilliant peers. You

will find that not all classes are easy to understand, not all teachers giving you easy answers. You

may hate the food in the mess, or dislike your roommate. All this is part of the game, and I

encourage you to see it as one. Take what comes your way in the right spirit. Enjoy how people are

different and think differently than you. Try to develop open and generous attitudes.

</p><p>Also, remember... your classmates, seniors and teachers...we are all here to help. You just have to

ask. You will find from your seniors that there are support groups available. If sadness hits you,

seek out help. Everybody is hit by it at one time or the other. Other than that, there are counsellors

on campus, and a psychiatrist. They are there to help you and to give you tools to deal with your

troubles. You do not have to lift the burden all by yourself. It’s a waste of time and emotion. Seek

help.
</p>
<p><h1>4. Keep up the enthusiasm: Join clubs. Make friends. Plan activities.
</p></h1>
<p>It is a truth, universally acknowledged, and what goes up will come down. You are going to need to

put in effort to keep your enthusiasm up. There are many students’ groups in the department and

in the institute. There are science and math clubs, dance and theater groups, music, cycling, and

many more. If you already know what you want to do, great. Continue your old hobbies. There are

classes available in and outside IISc.... join them. Find co-enthusiasts. If you don’t know what you

like, fantastic! Sky in the limit. If you can’t find groups already involved in activities you like, start

one yourself.
</p>
<p>Now here is something I can’t stress this enough: it is essential... absolutely essential...that you

make friends. You may be a loner by nature, and you may function best when you are alone. Still...

it is a must, when you are away from home, to have people who will answer when you call. This is

just a practical suggestion. Unfortunately, you will often find language-based...state-based groups

in IISc-UG. They end up becoming so tight that nobody else can enter. Since this is MY list, and

my blabbering, I would just mention that I wish this was not so. I’d rather see people form close

bonds based on something less superficial.
</p>
<p><h1>5. Step outside IISc.
</p></h1>
<p>Bangalore may be crowded and often dirty, but it is many cities in one. It is an old city with very

interesting history and culture. It is a new city with fantastic food, music, dance and theater.

Bangalore is surrounded by waterfalls, forests and geography worth visiting. Short one-day treks

are very doable. IISc is just one very small aspect of this city. Explore Bangalore. Find the various

groups that organize walks through town: Old city walks, science walks, art walks, tree walks.

There are painting groups and food clubs and poetry clubs and comedy clubs. Don’t remain limited

to the institute.
</p>
<p><h1>6. Think why you are here.
</p></h1>
<p>Understand, that you are not living in vacuum. Understand that as a scientist and as a science

student, it is expected that you become contributing citizens of the world Always... ALWAYS...

keep this in mind.</p>
