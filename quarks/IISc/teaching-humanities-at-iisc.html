					“Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.” – Albert Einstein			
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Bitasta Das is the permanent Humanities instructor here at IISc. She has been an active part of every humanities course, even the ones she wasn’t personally teaching.		
				</p>
				
				<p>
					2011 is a momentous year for the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, as it inaugurated its first ever Undergraduate Programme that endows Bachelor of Science (Research) degree. That year is also significant in the history of the institute for another reason— Humanities began to be taught for the first time as part of its UG curriculum. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Humanities or the study of the human world is a discrete academic field today. Moral Philosophy of the 18th century, whose primarily concern was to investigate the question, “what is the best way for people to live?” is considered to be the precursor of this area of knowledge. Humanities in the course of time evolved as a distinct field of inquiring human civilization and culture. The Humanities curriculum at IISc is unprecedented in many ways. First, unlike in other Science institutes of the country, Humanities here is a compulsory subject in six out of the eight semesters of the BS Programme. Also, the nature of the curriculum is unique. In the sense that, the focus here is to introduce the budding scientists to the socio-cultural milieu in which they are learning Science and not on teaching Humanities as a set of unrelated discipline. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The curriculum is designed in such a way that Humanities is not taught as add-on or optional courses but demonstrates convergence and synergy with natural science questions and therefore is relevant and useful to science students. The courses of the first three semesters are foundational, titled: Ways of Knowing, Ways of Seeing and Ways of Doing. The last three are relatively advanced, titled: Mapping India through the Folk Arts, Journalism for Scientists and Introduction to Governance. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					The Centre for Contemporary Studies (CCS) of the institute, headed by Prof. Raghavendra Gadagkar, Chairman of CCS, conducts the Humanities course for the UG Programme. The Visiting Faculty of CCS and invited instructors, consisting of experts and practitioners from various fields, teach the different courses. Though I was associated with the UG Programme in various capacities since I joined CCS in 2011, I was appointed Instructor Humanities- UG Programme in July 2014. Till date, I am the sole appointed Humanities instructor. I teach one module in the first semester, Cultural Analysis and the course Mapping India through the Folk Arts in the fourth semester. However, I attend all the classes of all the batches and assist in the conduct of the classes, exams and results. Therefore I get to interact with the students throughout their six semesters. This is by far the best part of my association with the UG Programme—the interaction with the bright, inquisitive minds. 
				</p>
					
				<p>
					IISc being India’s premier Science research institute, the ambience, facility and teaching Science here is undoubtedly among world’s best. In this setting, introducing Humanities to the young Science enthusiasts calls for building a firm context. It has been a common trend every year to have two sets of students: one who understands and appreciates the importance of learning Humanities along with the Sciences and the other who are sceptic. Both these sets contribute in the advancement of knowledge, the first set by enhancing what they already value and the second set by questioning and countering in their process of rebuttal. The challenge for me, as a teacher, is to relentlessly strive to let the contrasting thought processes coexist. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I would like to delve a little into the courses I teach. The shorter one, Cultural Analysis, that I have started teaching since last year is the first module of the first semester Humanities course. I use this module to open up the question, “Is culture important for scientists?” As the classes progress we look into the various lenses through which we understand culture. The other semester long, Mapping India through the Folk Arts is the Humanities course for the fourth semester. The third edition of this course concluded in January-April 2016 semester. Each year we explore one form of art- visual, narrative or performative; for the 2012 batch it was folk visual arts, for 2013 batch it was folk music and for the 2014 batch it was folk theatre. This course is an attempt to introduce the students to Indian multiculturalism and also to understand the nation a little better through its rich folk art repertoire. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In both the courses, my attempt is to sensitize the students to the fact that as human beings they cannot remain insulated from the social context in which they practice Science. The problems of the rapidly globalizing world are multilayered and are often interconnected. They demand knowledges and methodologies which straddle several disciplines for arriving at solutions that are holistic and inclusive. In order to recognize the big picture, understanding the nation and its people are absolute necessity, so that being members of science and technology community, they can provide effective leadership. In a country like India where majority of the population resides in rural, technologically untouched societies, it is the folk lexicon that gives expression to their worldview. Looking at the folk artefacts appears a worthy exercise for the blooming scientists of this country for meaningfully engaging with the milieu they reside in. So far the attempts can be said to have been successful. This is reflected in the splendid works of art that the students have produced as part of their assignments for the course. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The assignments for the courses are given to encourage exploration of disciplinary boundaries. 2012 batch was asked to represent a scientific concept through any visual folk art form of India, 2013 batch was asked to produce folk songs about Science or life at IISc and 2014 batch was asked to stage folk plays that either had Science as their theme or articulated a contemporary problem. The mantra we apply for creating the art works is “borrow and share” instead of “buy and rent”. The effort that the students made and the result they produced in the limited time and resources will make any teacher proud! The art works of the 2012 batch has been published as a pictorial book by IIScPress. We are exploring ways in which the assignments of the other batches can also be documented appropriately. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To sum up my experience of teaching Humanities to more than a hundred Science students per batch, has been both a pleasure and a challenge. It is a privilege to teach the cream of the country, who join this institute after qualifying tough competitive exams. These students come with genuine zeal and passion for scientific research. Science today has emerged as the most powerful phenomenon. It is a mark of certainty and authority. Humanities on the other hand advocate creativity and critical thinking, subversion being the core of its nature. It is yet more important to buttress the Science students with Humanities to restrain the peril of dogmatism, such as religions once exploited. What informs paintings and poetry? Why respect someone else’s culture? How history is made? Pondering over such questions could only be a worthwhile exercise for scientists! 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					An anecdote I would like to give which tell a tale of the students’ approach towards Humanities instructors is, I was once made to take care of a puppy for a week because apparently that is what Humanities commend!

						Going by my likes and dislikes in general, a city would be an embodiment of everything I am ardently against. They’re chaotic and unruly, and there’s far too much happening for my tiny human brain to keep track of, let alone comprehend. Keeping that in mind, I’ve always wondered why I’m particularly drawn to large cities.<a href="quarks/Non-IISc/viva-la-vida.html"><span></span></a>
