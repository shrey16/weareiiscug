					When I was in second grade, my daily afternoon ritual was -- coming back from school, taking a short nap, and then as the clock struck 6, fight with my grandfather over the television remote. The remote was very important to both of us for that half an hour--6 to 6:30--because, he wanted to see the news headlines for the day, and I wanted to see Dragon Ball Z, which used to come on the Cartoon Network Channel. Dragon Ball Z was the first addiction I had, and it engrossed me so much, that if you looked through any of my books or notebooks, you could almost surely find doodled versions of the main characters, and doodled amalgams of protagonists, who were routinely born in my imagination, only to die as my interest in imagining them fizzled out. Almost two years after, when I started watching another entertainment channel, Animax, I got hooked on to another anime--as Japanese cartoon is called--named Inuyasha. And after that, with the purchase of the desktop computer which still sits on my desk back home, (although, now it’s a ship of Theseus), I dived into the world of Manga, the origin of anime. And this jump wasn’t just into a particular genre of literature, it was a lunge into a whole culture of a country--it would lead me to read books like Sanshiro by Natsume Sōseki, Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, to mention just a few, to take the JLPT Level N1 exam, to take a strong interest in Japanese movies from Jiruba no Tetsu, Ran and Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa and Gohatto by Nagisha Oshima to the much more modern Departures by Yōjirō Takita and The Little House by Yoji Yamada. My taste in Japanese music had started off with the opening and ending scores in various animes, and now has progressed to listening to not only to genres like pop and alternative rock, but also the gagaku music, which is the court music that is played in the Japanese imperial court.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not the only one who had started out with an anime or a manga, and had progressively become immersed in the Japanese culture. Neither am I the only person who is almost regularly asked what pleasure I find in reading comics and watching cartoon. I also ask myself, what is it about manga that is so immersive?
				</p>
<h1>Manga: Origins</h1>
				<p>
					Manga is a word primarily used to refer to comics created in Japan or comics created using the Japanese language as a medium and conforms to a particular art of style. In nativity, the term is used to refer to both comics and cartoons, however, internationally, manga is used to describe the comics, while the term “anime” is used for describing the cartoons. Breaking the word “Manga”, (kanji: 漫画), it comes to the two kanji man meaning ‘without a reason’ or ‘in vain’ and can also be understood as “whimsical” or “impromptu” or “playful” or lax” and ga meaning “pictures”. The exact origins of manga remain unclear, in spite of the arduous searches. One view is that manga originates from the basic human desire to record and express the surroundings of oneself, beginning from basic scribbles and doodles. It has been speculated that the influential 19th century artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), the maker of the famous 19th century ukiyo-e (“floating world pictures”) and the iconic woodblock print images of 36 Views of Mount Fuji, was the first person to use the term and his sketchbooks are one of the earliest examples of Japanese humorous art. He sketched funny images of faces, blind men examining an elephant and many more on the same note. Finally he went on to produce, the 15 volume series of books Hokusai manga, which are widely regarded as the true ancestors of manga literature.
				</p>
				<p>Even before Katsuhika Hokusai, we can find picture scrolls, the contents of which can be roughly termed as manga. These picture scrolls are from the 6th and 7th centuries, illustrated by buddhist monks. The most famous of these works is Choujuugiga, meaning “Animal scrolls” or “Illustration of Frolicking Animals”, a work by the monk Kakuyu (1053-1140) that depicted animals behaving like humans and satirized the life of Buddhist priests. Manga, had initially started out as an art form that depicted comic situations, using humour and satire.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early 18th century, with the development and widespread use of woodblock printing, this picturised literature started to gain more popularity. Despite its sometime satirical take, due to its innate comical aspect, it was easily accepted as light literature--nothing threatening, rather a form of light entertainment--by the feudal authorities, who had strictly banned any sort of instigatory or political themes in literature, and therefore not penalised. Also, through the history of east-asian literature, we can find a relatively close picture-to-language relationship. In cultures with Kanji (Chinese characters carrying different meanings and therefore always leaving possibilities for different combinations), it is easier to communicate where letters and words are combined with drawing, and used interlockingly to convey an expression. The first book form of such work was Toba-e books that were distributed in Osaka. The early 18th century saw the commercial availability of giga (caricature) images to the public, and by the 19th, boosted by the commercial success, major woodblock print artists began producing prints with the influence of giga images. Examples include the numerous giga prints produced by Kuniyoshi (1797-1861). And with this, the forerunners of manga gained a firm foothold onto the Japanese psyche, though not yet in the form that we see it today.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next major revolution in manga art, or better put “gharana”, would come with the Second World War, like many other things in the world. Perhaps wars aren’t just conflicts, they are also catalysts of sudden bursts of creative zeal. However, the changes in the artscape of manga had begun at the turn of the century.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the dawn of the 20th century, Japanese artwork in comics started to become more and more open to the influences from the Western world. Rakuten Kitazawa was one such artist who embraced this East meets West gharana. He was inspired by popular comic strips The Yellow Kid by Richard Felton Outcault and The Katzenjammer Kids by Rudolph Dirks, and it led him to draw popular comics, such as Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu (Tagosaku and Mokube’s Sightseeing in Tokyo). In 1905, he founded Tokyo Puck, a magazine to promote the publications of Japanese cartoonists. Another notable artist who would explore this trend more and more was Ippei Okamoto, who would also be the person who would found the first cartoonist society of Japan, Nippon Mangakai.
				</p>

				<p>
					This century would be one of the most exciting and cataclysmic for the country. And yet as the Japanese left their feudal days behind to embrace a new world, the country boiled with an infectious energy, which many artists would tap into to fuel the changing landscapes of art and literature. But this was the just the beginning, for the Land of the Rising Sun would soon go into war.
				</p>
				<p>
					Manga as we see it today, first came into existence by the hands of Osamu Tezuka, a medical student and Machiko Hasegawa.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the after-effects of the Second World War was that many of the pre-war large publishing houses went out of business, for a variety of reasons. With this development, a new sort of publishing business came to life--the little red books. And one of the authors of these little red books was Osamu Tezuka.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tezuka’s first comic was Shintakarajima, or New Treasure Island. But he found comic as a medium insufficient. To make it more visually appealing and arresting, Tezuka started using cinematic techniques. And eventually he gave birth to the immensely popular manga, Mighty Atom, known as Astro Boy internationally. (Sound familiar? Used to come on Cartoon Network).
				</p>
<h1>Manga: Post-War to Today</h1>
				<p>
					As Tezuka started doing panel after panel of work, he decided to use cinematic view techniques. And for Sazae-san, Hasegawa also made panel art using these techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both Astro Boy and Sazae-san were post-war mangas. And if we look at the style of these two mangas as compared to their predecessors, we would be able to see a post-war trend. By this I mean that, both of the main characters have selfless heroism, unflinching loyalty towards friends, or the country and unsubtle anti-war messages. These were the manga of the next generation, carrying the memory of the terrible war that would end with two atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
				</p>
				<p>
					Astro Boy was created in the US’ occupation years of Japan, and Tezuka was influenced by the ideas of the Western world—in particular French and Germanic forms of art and literature that he came across. The US soldiers brought with them the earlier animations of Disney—Mickey Mouse, Bambi. This didn’t just influence Tezuka, this was a major source of influence and inspiration to many other contemporaries of Tezuka. Momotaro’s Divine Sea Warriors, the first feature-length anime film, was released in 1945. Tezuka would go on to establish his own animation company—Mushi Productions, and in 1963, Astro Boy was first broadcast in Japanese TV and went on to become the first Japanese television series to really create and form the aesthetic that became known internationally as anime. Tezuka was also responsible for the unique “large eyes” style that has become a distinctive feature of manga and anime today, both for cuteness and derision.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular, Sazae-san was a manga with a quite a modern spin. Sazae-san was a housewife who would often end up in comic, but trying situations. She was more interested in being herself than to look presentable or finding a husband—which were considered important duties for women in the Japanese society. But the war, like many other places, had drawn women to the front line—in particular, in industries and other governmental services. After the bombing occurred, Japan was attempting to rebuild itself—infrastructures, rehabilitation, military—and it could not do so with a large percentage of its population sitting at home. Hasegawa was forward-thinking, and like God had so debatably done with the human race, she created Sazae-san in the image of herself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cultural exchange between US and Japan in the occupation and Post-occupation years went both ways. During the 1960s, Astro Boy became the first anime series to be broadcast outside Japan. In the 1970s and 80s, other adaptations of anime made significant impact in overseas markets. Two of those series, Robotech and Star Blazers introduced mature themes. Star Blazers, broadcast in the U.S. in 1979, dealt with many issues before they became global concerns as they are today, such as radiation poisoning, acid rain, and global warming. In the show’s first season, humans were forced to move underground to avoid radiation poisoning. Star Blazers was also the first popular English-dubbed anime series with a storyline that required the episodes be shown in order.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trend set by these two mangas would continue to persevere, especially in the 1980’s, with mangas like Dragon Ball, (Created by Akira Toriyama and first published in 1984 it follows Goku and his friend Bulma as they explore a mythical earth, learning martial arts and searching for “dragonballs” that summon a magical dragon who assists them in times of danger)--ideas of courage in the face of insurmountable threats, loyalty to the point of death, and in general, the ideas of good prevailing over evil, and a heroism that was military oriented. Even today, modern mangas such as Bleach (created by Noriaki Kubo and first published in 2001 and still continuing), continue to stick to this general trend.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the manga market continued to grow in Japan and overseas, the genres started to diversify to a great extent. With this emerged the different classes (if that is the correct term to use) of manga, and very often than not, this classes were gender-based. Manga for male readers have been classified into--boys up to 18 years old (shōnen manga) and young men 18 to 30 years old (seinen manga). Another approach to classification is done by content, rather than age. Here we have the third class for male readers—sexually overt manga aimed at grown men and also called seijin (“adult,” 成人) manga. For female readers, the manga written is called Shōjo manga.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another content based genre which is remarkable in its own right is Gekiga. The word Gekiga means means “drama pictures” and refers to a form of aesthetic realism in manga. This style drawing is emotionally dark, often starkly realistic, sometimes very violent, and focuses on the day-in, day-out grim realities of life, often drawn in gritty and unpretty fashions. Some famous manga of the Gekiga genre are— Koike and Kojima’s Lone Wolf and Cub and Akira, an apocalyptic tale of motorcycle gangs, street war, and inexplicable transformations of the children of a future Tokyo.
				</p>

				<p>
					One interesting thing to note would be see that unlike the comic superheroes—Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Spectre, Captain America, in the world of manga, costumed superheroes never have been very popular. Superman-esque heroes like Goku never attempted to hide their identity and though they seemed to have a standard dress for fighting, it was never a stylized costume. Modern mangas such as Bleach and Naruto have stylized dresses, but they serve to reflect ethnicity or class or a level of power, rather hiding the identity of the wearer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Manga has made the Japanese publishing markets one of the most vigorous in the world. The gross sales from publishing in 2002 was 2.3 trillion yen. The total number of published materials including magazines was over 750 million. 22.6% of total sales, or 38.1% of published material sold in 2002 are of manga (Figure 1). Since they peaked in 1995, both the percentage of manga in published material and the publishing industry as a whole have been on a decline, due to piracy and scanlation. Still, manga remains one of the pillars of Japanese economy. Overseas, the largest market of manga is currently North America.
				</p>

				<p>
					Manga now includes topics like heroism to gritty avant-garde realism and political thrillers like Sanctuary. It has varied complicated topics which explore the meaning of morality and humanity--Mirai Nikki, Ghost in the Shell, Neon Genesis Evangelion (Though this is not a manga) are classics.
				</p>

				<p>
					Apart from just the manga volumes, Manga culture has spawned a great number of tertiary industries. Some of the greatest annual events if the world are held in Tokyo. In Japan and many other countries, you have Manga cafes, places where customers can read from a library of manga for a specified time at a corresponding fee. Guests are free to borrow and return books as many times as they wish within the time limit. There are Maid cafes were originally created to fulfil the fantasies of fans of maid-themed manga and anime.
				</p>

				<p>
					Anime conventions such as Anime Expo, Otakon, and JACON, started in the early 1990s and are currently held annually in cities across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Many convention attendees take part in cosplay where they dress up as anime characters. Japanese artists, voice actors, film directors and musicians are invited to the conventions. Colleges, high schools, and community centers outside Japan, even in India have started hosting anime clubs, as a way to share and exhibit anime and manga. As the popularity of manga and anime continues to grow, so does the world’s knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture.

After all, hostel rooms seem to serve no better purpose than provide a soft bed to rest on during the night and turn into a locker to keep our belongings safe during the day. <a href="quarks/IISc/a-space-of-ones-own.html"><span></span></a>

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
