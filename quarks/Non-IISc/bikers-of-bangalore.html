					Rishav Mallick describes himself as a seismologist by day, and a cyclist by earlier in the day. An obsessive cyclist, Rishav has competed in numerous races held in and around Bangalore. The Quarks team managed to catch up with the speedster to hear his views about the road cycling scene in Bangalore, and how he made it to the pro-cycling arena.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>First let's get to know a bit about you. What brought you to IISc?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					I finished my undergrad from NIT Surathkal, but I wasn’t really happy with engineering, and I’d done a lot of projects which had pushed me towards geoscience.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>So what did you study in NIT?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					I did chemical engineering. I came here with the intention of doing geochemistry, especially particle modelling and geochemistry. But after coming here, you get disillusioned, and then you realize that what you were looking for is not what you really want to do. Stuff like that always happens: you’re always misguided as an undergrad, if you haven’t really tried your hand at what you think you like. I knew I wanted to do geoscience, but I was not very fixed on what. So that’s why I came to IISc, and the M.Tech program was just starting off, and I initially thought I’d join CAOS, but then, it just so happened that the M.Tech program opened here (Earth Science Dept.) as well. It was a good fit. That’s how IISc.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>So you've moved on from geochemistry to…?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently what I’m doing is studying the physics of faulting. How cracks propagate and so on. We don’t really work on cracks initiate, but how cracks propagate in a tectonic framework. The scale of stresses is much larger than what you see in rock mechanics labs, which have these Cartesian coordinates in these blocks, which are stressed. But what I study happens on a much larger scale; it’s in spherical coordinates, and it’s on the earth, it’s not in a lab. The idea is to work on earthquakes using seismic data and geodesy, that is INSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and GPS. And if you’re lucky, which is in a way, unlucky, but if you have tsunamis, that helps a lot in gauging what’s going to happen. That’s what I’m going to work on now.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>So let's get to business. At what point can you say you started getting into cycling?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					When I lived in the campus, I lived in the PD block. It’s on the other side of the campus; it was pretty far. I realized, okay, got to get myself a bicycle. So, I bought a rockrider, like everyone else because it’s cooler than the btwin mybike, but it’s not expensive enough to get you worried. So I got myself a rockrider and it was my commute bike. There was this one pretty adventurous chap in my department. He organizes these adventure series talks in Centre for Earth Science. He’s into bouldering, and hiking and a lot of trekking. He also did cycling for a while and took up running. He was like, “You know what, let’s try going and checking out Hessarghatta. Twenty-five kilometres dude!”. And I was like, “Yeah man, let’s do it and make a day of it.” There was also this added incentive to do so. I’d taken up running and cycling at the same time. That was because my girlfriend at the time said that I was getting fat, I’d put on weight. That was a bit of a poke I didn’t recover very well from…
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>We'd rather say you recovered very well from that poke.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Point to be noted, I was never fat. There was that, and the fact that in IISc you see a lot of people cycling. When I joined the cycling community in IISc, it was on its decline, which meant it still had some activity, it wasn’t completely dead, but it was slowly dying. We still had people who were doing brevets and randonneuring, things like that. You’d meet people and they’d tell you that, “You know what, I just rode like a thousand kilometres in the last 90 hours.”, and you’d be like, “Why the hell, man! Why did you do that?”. But slowly, that became commonplace. They’d be like, “I just did 200 km last night, and then I’ll do 150 this afternoon.” And your reply would be, “Cool. Okay thanks bye.” But the thing is, you hear this more and more, and then it becomes commonplace, you think it’s not a big deal. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You start with a 50k ride, and then you tell yourself, “If I do two of them, that’s 100k. Let’s just do it.” I’d say the scene at that time was pretty encouraging as cyclist who’s just starting out. Even if you didn’t have big goals and aspirations, there were people at different levels. The whole spectrum from absolute novice to just novice. There were no serious cyclists: there have not been serious cyclists from IISc, but the initial stages, where you need company, there you did have company at IISc. That was really nice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>So how'd you get from there to where you are now? Now you do mainly races, not long distance, right?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s a tricky question really. Maybe it was buying a road bike? No that was not it. Doing long distance cycling has one real annoying drawback. Everyone at home is constantly worried. It’s because you’re riding with no support, wearing this silly reflective vest and you have a stupid light and anyone can come and hit you. When you get tired, you just stop on the side of the road and you go off to sleep. Someone could steal your bike and go away. It’s not a very good deal. And it feels like you’re kind of short-changing yourself because it’s so easy and not very competitive. It’s the kind of scene where everyone is very nice, and just finishing it is a big deal, not finishing it fast. At our age, just finishing is not enough. Just like clearing IIT-JEE was not a big deal. You want something out of it. You don’t want to do it just for the heck of doing it. I think that works when you’re forty or fifty years old, when you’re calm enough to maintain a steady pace for the next 10 hours and I’ll just look at the countryside which is really beautiful. I have all my baggage on me. I’ll take a bath whenever I want to, when I see a stream. I’m self-sufficient, and I’m doing it because I like touring. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In my case that didn’t really fly with me; brevets and touring weren’t really my thing. It was then when I bought a road bike. And then I turned up for a couple of these local races. They’re organized by this group called BBCh, Bangalore Bicycling Championships. There was a huge turnout, lots of states, and lots of people from Karnataka. There were various categories; there was an elite category, an amateur category, U-18 category, Masters, for older riders and women’s category. You can participate in whichever category you think is appropriate for you, you find people at similar levels. The races here where shorter, e.g. 50k, 100k, 200k. But despite being short races, at the end of the day, you get your ass handed to you, and you’ve raced your heart out, you’ve nothing left. You just die after the race. I liked that. I liked that a lot more. It felt like I was doing something where you could win. It felt like a competitive sport. In college, when we played football, or even went swimming, it was always a race. There was always a point of beating someone’s ass, or crying after you’d lost, or plotting revenge. It was still a sport; it wasn’t just a team building activity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Competitive cycling was that thing, which I rediscovered. I really liked it. But making that jump from just cycling to actively cycling at that competitive level, that takes a lot of time, a lot of coaching. You have to give up a lot of things. You need a very solid routine. You can’t go partying whenever you want to. You don’t need to watch what you eat all the time, but you need to start being picky. Mess food just doesn’t cut it. That much rice, and just one piece of fried chicken.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Do you train in the morning? Do you train every day?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yeah, I do train in the morning. I train about 5 or 6 days a week. Mondays are my off days. I don’t get on the bike at all on Mondays. The other six days are a mix of hard rides and recovery rides.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>You said you need a good coach and decent peer group to get into racing. How did you get your peer group and coach?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					At some level, it has to do with your initial talent itself. You can’t go from being completely average to suddenly finding a spot. You need to have either a spark, or you need to believe in yourself. So in my case, I was lucky, I had a bit of that spark. When I first started racing, I used to do a lot of time trials. Time trials are where you don’t race in a bunch, you race solo. So it’s you, against yourself, against the wind, against the clock. So you’re not racing against anyone else. You’re basically trying to be as fast as you can be. The thing about cycling is, unlike running, wind resistance is the biggest factor that impedes speed. The strongest rider is not the guy who is going to win the race. It’s the guy who’s been sneaky, who stayed out the wind for the longest and has accelerated fastest when it mattered. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cycling is slightly different from all other sports. It’s all about being as aerodynamic as possible. Conserving, conserving, conserving as much. During time trials, all that doesn’t matter. All you need to be is the strongest rider. If you just get into the zone, just hammer the shit out, you can really do well, you can be fast. The first few time trials I did, I ended up being pretty competitive and pretty fast. There are a couple of amateur teams in Bangalore that noticed that, and asked me whether I’d like to train with them. That’s where I got picked up.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>When did you get your first road bike?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Sometime in 2014; March of 2014. And I ended up joining this team, this team was called Spectrum Racing, in the January of 2015. I was always riding with other people. During coursework, it’s a little tough to manage cycling and coursework. The toughest part of cycling is you do it in the morning. It’s very tough to do it in the afternoon or in the evenings because traffic picks up. And you’re tired, you’re really tired. The moment you come back after a hard ride, you’re really tired, and you feel like you can’t get into the zone for class. But the good thing is, you’re actually much more alert. I don’t know if it’s just me, but I’ve spoken to a lot of other people who agreed. After hard workouts in the mornings, even people who go to the gym say the same thing, they come back and feel really energized and level headed. So it worked out awesome for me. So I’d cycle in the morning, come back, go to class, do my work. It became like a very structured routine.
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s the thing with cycling. It forces you to get into a routine. You can’t be too much of a loose cannon and take any endurance sport very seriously. You need to have crazy genes and really good inherent talent to manage that, but as Indians, we aren’t encouraged to do a huge amount of sports as kids. Europeans in general, have an advantage there. Since they’re twelve, they would’ve picked up a bike and gone to the local races. They’d be running all the time. A lot of my friends whom I race with come from the US. They were like alpine skiers when they were 14 or 15. They were into rowing. From rowing and alpine skiing, making the transition to cycling is easy, because you’re already well trained. In India we play cricket. You spend most of the time standing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What is the longest ride you have been on? What are some pointers you would give to aspiring touring cyclists?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					My longest ride was this 600k brevet that I once did. It was a brevet, which required the participants to finish the 600 kilometres in the stipulated amount of time. That was about the time I started hating it because you get really tired. I did the first 300 km really fast and then I got so sleepy. Unimaginably sleepy. The race was supposed to finished in 40 hours, but I managed to finish it in 30 hours. Out of those 30 hours, I cycled for about 20 hours, and take intermittent naps and breaks in between lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour. I’d keep thinking, I’m almost there, just 100k to go, but 5k later, I couldn’t go on any more. I’d be craving food; my legs were empty. And bum sore as hell. There’s this common problem of being on the saddle for too long, and if the saddle is not fit perfectly for you, then one can suffer chafing. Don’t be surprised if you hear cyclists talking about their crotch all the time. It sounds weird to outsiders, but fellow cyclists will empathize.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot depends on clothing, really. When you start cycling you don’t really think of it. When I started cycling I just wore cotton shorts and cotton tees. But the body hugging lycra actually pays dividends. Because (a), It wicks moisture away really well. Then, if you notice cycling bib shorts probably, you’ll see that it looks like adult diapers. There’s a padded foam material in the nethers, and mainly that acts as your cushioning blanket of sorts. That is what makes your ride comfortable. All that really matters as you ride longer and harder, you feel that you may have to move away from just putting something on to wearing the right stuff.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>So when you got your road bike did you know you’d eventually get into competitive cycling?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					That was the plan. I started watching a lot of bike racing on the internet; you don’t get to see much on TV. So, it looked really interesting to me. I knew I’d always want to get into competitive cycling. That was the end goal. Or that was always the goal, not the end goal. There are different levels of it. I knew I wanted to race, not just ride for the fun of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>So it must have been an investment, right? We’re given to understand that road bikes are kind of expensive?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					It’s not as expensive as you think. It can be, it can be really expensive if you let it be. But as a miserly, or I would say as a frugal student, I tried to not be spendthrift, I tried to be, you know, be watchful of how much money I spent on cycling. Because, you need replacements. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The investment is around, between 25,000 to 30,000 rupees is what you start with. And then you feel like, you know, I don’t like these wheels. I want better wheels, I want lighter wheels, I want more aerodynamic wheels. I want everything more aero. I want a more aero kit, I want a more aero helmet, I don’t want to ride with glasses, I want like cooler looking glasses. People become vain. Even if I’m not fast, I want to look good for the photos. You can let it go out of hand, you can let it go really out of control and spend like a lot of money. But if you’re ok with looking douche, let your legs do the talking. But after I got on a pro cycling team, that was this team called Giant India Racing. So they sponsored the bikes and kit and stuff like that. With that I got a really good bike, and that changed a lot of things.
				</p>
				<p>
					You don’t have to spend that money on a frame and on the bike anymore. You can spend it on other things, nutrition, or better wheels. But I did not. I still tried to not spend as much money as possible. But there are people who would. In cycling, you can buy speed. You can buy fitness. The more money you spend, the more aerodynamic your frame and wheels, the more supple your tyres are. That makes you much faster for the same effort. If you’re willing to spend more money, more and more money, you can get faster without actually doing anything more. That’s always an option.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The team you are in now is the first tier of racing, isn't it?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					So, there’s a bit of an oddity there. I used to be in this amateur cycling team called Spectrum Racing. I moved to this pro team called Giant India Racing. But that team disbanded in March. So, our goals were the states and nationals, and the moment the nationals were over, which was in late February, the team disbanded and I went back to my amateur racing team.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>How common are accidents and injuries in this sport?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					(Shows us the multiple injuries on his arms.) These are just the ones on display, there are more. You crash. You crash quite a lot. The thing is, it may or may not entirely be your fault. Even if you’re really careful, if someone goes down in front of you, it’s very likely he’s going to pull you down with him. So it’s preferable to stay in the front of a pack in a race. A lot of times, there are guys who aren’t very good with handling themselves in a bunch. So if you have a very technical circuit, they might be the ones who get nervous and move around. So what happens when you’re racing in a bunch, a lot of times there’s a lot of contact. Or you push someone away. If you’re not comfortable with that, you get kind of jittery and you squirrel around a lot. And so you might get nervous and overlap wheels, because you’re in such close contact. If you just don’t focus for a fraction of a second, you might get your front wheel clipped by someone’s rear wheel. The moment that happens, you have no control over your front wheel. You will crash. Or if you’re racing really hard and there’s a pothole in the middle of the road as has happened to me before. The guys in front, there are 20 people in front of you. So you have no sight of what’s in front. You are relying only on the people in front of you to point stuff out. But if they don’t, and they just branch out suddenly, and there’s a pothole right there, you will go and crash into it.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have to trust who you ride with. In races, you will see me generally always near the front because in India we still haven’t gotten to that level where we communicate very well in a race. We don’t point out that, oh look, there’s pothole, move away. And it’s open roads, remember. There could be a guy coming on the wrong side of the road. There’s always some random two wheeler who is on the wrong side of the road. If you don’t notice it at the front and suddenly swerve, the guy behind you can get knocked down. So, its preferable to constantly be alert. Crashes happen a lot. It’s very common for a cyclist. About breaking a collar bone: Another cyclists joke is, you haven’t turned pro until you’ve broken at least one collar bone. Breaking one is semi pro and breaking both is pro. So, I’m still semi pro.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Our last question, what advice would you give someone who is trying to get into the cycling scene here in India?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Go race a bit. Go for these races, they’re a lot of fun. They’re very cheap, to register for, and they’re very well organized. And you meet a LOT of people who cycle. Cycling is a community sport almost, at least at the basic level it is a very community driven sport. Just go meet people, go cycle. It’s fun, you get to eat a lot of good food. When you first start cycling, you can justify eating any food, ‘I’m burning off the calories anyway!’ And you go to like these quaint places outside the city, and you meet really nice people. The moment you leave the city, people just become a fraction nicer. The further you are, the nicer they get. They’ll see you cycling all the way, tired, and they’ll say, ‘Ok, let me take care of this guy, it looks like he’s going to die. Take water, cold water, some fresh milk if you want.’ It’s a nice experience. Just exploring, and that feeling of freedom when you’re out, away from smoke being puffed in your face in the city. That’s actually a very relaxing feeling, at least it was for me. It still is, I love passion rides. You find a road which you feel like there’s no one on it, just mindlessly just go. It’s a bicycle, it can take any road, just go. You’ll always discover these gems of places.

							Hostel room decoration is seen by many as being frivolous and inane. The very thought of cleaning your own room is sure to send chills down the spine. After all, hostel rooms seem to serve no better purpose than provide a soft bed to rest on during the night and turn into a locker to keep our belongings safe during the day. <a href="quarks/IISc/a-space-of-ones-own.html"><span></span></a>

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
