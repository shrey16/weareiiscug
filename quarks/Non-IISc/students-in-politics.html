				<p>
					Frustration over the political scenario in India was pretty much universal, that is to say, across the nation – at least till two to three years ago. Students as a community were a major face of this frustration. Today, if I am to reconsider this statement – I would definitely add this. Students as a community are now prospectively a major political force as well. As I begin this essay – I am bothered by a few questions in this very regard. 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What does it take for a student to become politically motivated?</li>
					<li>How significant is the fact that this is ‘student force’?
					<li>Why am I considering the students to be a prospective and growing political force? The events and happenings besides, what do people (academics, politicians, students themselves, the middle class, the working class, etc.) think?</li>
					<li>How potent has this force been? How well-spread? What are the issues that it has been addressing?</li>
					<li>How do I hope this to effect and/or change the political scenario? The social structure? What are the issues this is addressing?</li>
					<li>What are the contending political ideologies in the students’ sphere? How are their activities different? What role has the political parties played in this whole process?</li>
					<li>What is the role of social media in this process? Alternate media?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					I shall try to discuss some of them in this essay. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a question of what it takes. When you face the brunt of wrongs being done to you, you don’t have much of a choice. And there is more to that as well. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I started this essay speaking of frustration. One could also speak of frustration being vented out. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My personal belief is that there is a bondage that is being forged. One is the bondage among students of different institutions. When I speak of a ‘student community’ – I speak of this bondage. This bondage causes one student of IISc to identify oneself with a student of University of Hyderabad and be agitated by the injustice there. This bondage causes one to be disturbed by the happenings in JNU. This bondage causes a student in Bangalore to feel guilty sitting in the mess because students in Kolkata are on a hunger strike. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Once this bondage is forged, it is sure to go beyond the ‘student community’. Then, you start feeling sorry for the rape victims of the cities, for the factory workers who don’t have any job security, for the tribal people whose hills are being appropriated for mining companies. And you start identifying yourself with them, you start feeling the same insecurity. It was a bondage of this sort that brought the citizens of Delhi together at Jantar Mantar when Nirbhaya had been brutally gang-raped. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This sort of bondage makes you want to do something about it. It is an inspiration of this sort that causes a student of IISc to work for the Notebook Drive, because he feels that everybody is not as privileged in educational opportunities as he is, and he strongly wants to remedy that. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is also a question of awareness. When you start feeling that a lot of things are going wrong, you’d want to ask whether the underlying system is a sane one or it is that the system is not being properly executed. If you’re convinced that the system is a fine one, in spite of your feelings and your conviction, the best you should do is be an ideal citizen and inspire and help others to be the same. Sometimes, you might want to be a more integral part of the system and its working, in joining mainstream politics or the administrative system. That is something I guess Mr. Kejriwal is doing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the light of such a situation, it is a very vital thing that this is a ‘student force’. Students being the future citizens, if such a conviction so as to set things right sets right into the students, it I very likely that they shall in future grow up very good citizens and ensure a proper working of the system. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Addressing the problem of a difficult popular mind-set, the answer possibly is social education. In that case, the movements should be, I guess, guided in that direction. Also, this drives home the significance of that the ‘future citizens’ are gearing up with a mind-set better suited to the system.  
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, you might be understanding that the system needs working on, then you are in for a much greater challenge. You first must persevere to understand how a better system should be (and this understanding is not to be a personal undertaking, as well) and then, you are faced with the challenge of transition from the current system to the better, idealized system. In the past, many a time such a transition has been through a process of rebellions and has been quite drastic – and the effects of such transitions themselves have often been reasons of botheration.
				</p>
				<p>
					I shall try to explain this one problem by examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					Take education, say. A lot of us feel that things are going wrong with it. You might feel that the problem in particular is that hon’ble minister Ms. Smriti Irani is herself not very well-educated by academic standards and that is the reason she is taking horrible decisions that are harmfully affecting the education scenario. Some of you may go even further to say that the ‘saffron ideologies’ are more particularly the deciding factors in this process, and possibly we ought to rise above that.
				</p>
				<p>
					But that still does not explain why most of us (if not all) in IISc are so very much well-to-do. It is supposed to admit students merely by merit, and it also allows for scholarships which would be more needful for someone who is not so well-to-do. And I don’t feel we have an education system which, even if run perfectly, could take care of that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have slightly touched upon the issue of hills being requisitioned by companies for mining. Let’s take the example of Niyamgiri, Dongria Kondh, and Vedanta. On ethical grounds that the land belongs to the Dongria, and on grounds of environmental concern – many of us may agree to that mining the heart of Niyamgiri is not the best thing to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					But that brings us to the question of whether we can do without those minerals, and if we are to mine those minerals – whom the profit of the enterprise would belong to. We must also address the question of whether we should try to actually be more economical with the minerals, and whether to truly achieve that would require us to ask for alternative economic systems.
				</p>				
				<p>
					For the question of what it takes, this is one important point to note. Transcending the bondages and convictions, we are faced with these questions and dilemmas. And, as one can observe, the student movements are truly trying to address these questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					A rough theoretical setting at hand, now I shall proceed to attempt at going through a recent history of some of the movements, briefly. Also, I shall brush past some other questions that I have initially mentioned.
				</p>
<h1>Timeline of student movements</h1>
<h2>September 2014 - #HokKolorob - Jadavpur University Protests</h2>
<p>
Popularly known as the Hok Kolorob Movement, this was sparked off when the university authorities authorized a brutal display of force by the police against a group of peacefully protesting students. This sparked off a series of student protests around the country condemning the use of state-authorized violence against a group of non-violent protesters.
</p>

<h2>July 2015 - #Scholarship - Pondicherry University Protests</h2>
<p>
These protests were precipitated by the lack of accommodation and the sudden termination of scholarships of many needy students. The matter escalated however, when the authorities condoned the use of violence against the student protesters.
</p>

<h2>November 2015 - #OccupyUGC - OccupyUGC Movement</h2>
<p>
This movement was triggered by the move by UGC that would cut off PhD funding for several thousand students. UGC cited a lack of transparency in the process of funding; on the other hand, the students on the other hand claim that cutting off funding is not the fix to the opacity in the procedure.
</p>

<h2>February 2016 - #JNU - JNU sedition controversy</h2>
<p>
The incident was sparked off when a student group condemned the hanging of Afzal Guru, calling it state mandated murder. Whereas a normal response to the statement should have been counterarguments, and other forms of debate, the situation escalated when the police got involved, leading the arrest of the Student Union president on charges of sedition.
</p>


				<p>
					A first look at some of these movements readily present this to us that the students were at stake when they decided to rally together. Either their academic careers, or their living conditions, or sometimes their democratic freedom. However, soon enough, these movements came to stand for ‘student unity and independent democratic voice’ and became socially way more significant. I would like especially to draw attention to the movements of Pondicherry University and of Jadavpur University.
				</p>
				<p>
					The movement in Pondicherry was initially triggered by low stipend, a closed library, poor hostel facilities and the like. However, it soon flamed up more fiercely when a police crackdown caused 30 students to be admitted to the hospital, and 50 were arrested. Goons were deployed by the vice-chancellor himself to attack the students heavily.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Jadavpur, too, the legendary rally of lakhs that defied the monsoon rains and filled the roads of Kolkata, had been in immediate effect ‘called forth’ due to a midnight police crackdown on protesting students on the campus. The movement had started with the demands of justice for a molestation victim.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both these movements demanded the respective vice-chancellors step down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such crackdown by police and political goons has been a common scene in many, or possibly all of the movements listed here. I believe, in the immediate cause of the movements – such incidents have seriously helped to forge unity among the students, and also raise tremendous upheaval in the civic society. However, it hurts me to say that neither has the civic society been always very sensitive.
				</p>
				<p>
					But, such monumental unity once forged – the students evidently turned into a serious political force. Speaking of Bengal – following Hokkolorob, students have taken a very active part in many civic and workers’ movements. Also, student movements followed in a number of universities – and unity among students was forged ‘transcending the barriers of different universities’.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, JNU, let’s say, has been politically very aware and active for a greater part of its existence, and its students and alumni have played a significant role in the shaping of Indian politics in quite some spheres. Also, it has raised a lot of very important social and political questions – generally overlooked otherwise. For one, it has been addressing the issue of dalits and moolvasis since 1990’s at the very least; and it has been an important centre of alternate cultural practice in this respect in the academic spheres.
				</p>
				<p>
					So while the OccupyUGC movement was triggered by an issue – the recent media debacle that brought JNU much more into discussion was caused by nothing more than a routine event, perhaps.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not to say that other universities have been politically dormant. (JU, say, led a serious movement in protest of the Nandigram massacre. Also, questions of gender have always been given serious consideration in many universities. ASA has championed the cause of the dalits in many a campus, UoH being one of them.) But I am merely pointing out that a lot of these movements actually started out with issues, and faced unnaturally severe police/political crackdowns that but enhanced the movements.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I have tried to propound – it has been observed that a greater student unity is developing out of these movements.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for Bengal – students from the universities of Jadavpur, Presidency, Calcutta, Viswa-Bharati, Burdwan have come together on many an occasion and regularly maintain contact. Such unity has also been significantly observed on a broader national level – especially since Rohith’s name has been there to forge such bonds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rohith deserves particular mention in this aspect. He has brought the dalit issue into a serious discussion – and it is no longer vote-bank-statistics that you may evade. His dreams have also added to the conviction of the student movement and unity. To discuss Rohith would require a lot more of space than I can afford, I shall just stop here, not before I quote Gopalkrishna Gandhi – "Time will tell, but this we can be certain of – Rohith Vemula’s note, written just before he withdrew from life, and Kanhaiya Kumar’s speech, delivered just before he was withdrawn from freedom, are thus far the two greatest testaments of 21st century India. They have been made out of the razor’s edge of truth. They will last for all time."
				</p>
				<p>
					There is another point which I shall but only mention. Many of these movements have been born out of spontaneity; and in spite of their decidedly political nature – they have remained quite free, sometimes very fiercely free of the stronghold or even influences of the political parties or their student wings. This is a very serious debate to address, whether the party influences and structuralism is to be adopted by this movement, and whether the movement should vehemently shun it; and what then would be the structure and form that these movements are to take. (Also political movements (I repeat, political, not civic) free of the stronghold of parties is not original to students’ movements. In West Bengal itself – we have observed such movements in Kamduni and Barasat much prior to #hokkolorob.) However, I shall again avoid addressing this debate here – space is running short.
				</p>
				<p>
					However – the point I want to make now – which again is factually well-supported, is that this united student force has started to poke their nose into a huge number of social and political problems, and very often has lent a hand and raised a voice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kolkata has seen students join the unemployed youth in their demands that the School Service Commission employ the selected candidates, has seen them raise money for Nepal, for floodstricken districts of Bengal, has seen them protest against the electricity tariff rise. Many an academic, student or teacher, from JNU has ever been a compassionate presence in the war-fields of Bastar – and they have led the ideological war in that aspect in the academic, civic and mainstream political spheres. JNU has constantly lent support to the workers of Maruti and other automobile manufacturers in Gurgaon. Students in Kolkata have lent their support to the struggle of jute-mill workers.
				</p>
				<p>
					University of Lahore lent its voice of support to JNU. Kolkata has also seen her students support a movement to save the Sundarbans in Bangladesh.
				</p>
				<p>
					One may have noted that I have been talking mostly of what politically they call ‘left’. I shall not deny that political drift, neither shall I deny that the ‘right’ – led by RSS, VHP, ‘Art of living’ and the like have been stirring up serious political activities among students, nor shall I deny that there is a serious ideological war going on in the student plane. If you ask me why I have almost omitted them, I have no option but to appeal to my personal bias.
				</p>
				<p>
					But I assure you – I do not consider them stupid ‘bhakt’s. They are anything but stupid, and they are every bit as dedicated and concerned about the problems our nation is facing. The ideological war is in what these parties believe can salvage us of this condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this carries for me all the significance in this essay that the students are being seriously concerned about broader socio-political problems and are actively trying to mitigate them. Also that they (both the ‘right’ and the ‘left’ – so as to say) believe that the system is not perfect, in some aspects – wrongful, and they have taken up the challenge to try to change it. They have waged a war against the system – and they are gearing up. This possibly can be milestone.
				</p>
				<p>
					In such restricted limits, it is difficult to argue for the novelty of the movements, and to address all the questions (rather, any of the questions) raised – I have merely tried to understand here ‘what is going on’ and attempted lamely at guessing significances.

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
