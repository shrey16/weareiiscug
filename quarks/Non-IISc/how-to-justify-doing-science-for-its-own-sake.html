					As British number theorist G. H. Hardy was often fond of saying, “No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.”, and was especially proud of the fact the number theory was the purest of sciences, and as such, would remain unsullied, safely out of reach of the corrupting influence that was human practicality. Pure mathematicians, and number theorists in particular, have taken this aphorism to heart, taking pride in the fact that their work has absolutely no real world applications. 				
				</p>
				<p>
					We, of course, have the luxury of hindsight, when we call out the error in Hardy’s statement. For not only has number theory not stayed detached from warlike purposes, it will probably occupy the central position in any war that happens in the future as number theory is the basis of all modern cryptography, and the second World War showed us the crucial role cryptography plays in any war. 				
				</p>
				
				<p>
					As any undergraduate who’s spent a summer working at a lab, trying to do whatever miniscule task or problem they’ve been assigned, which they hope counts as research, the following conversation with anyone not involved with their work, anyone who’s not familiar of how things work in research, is painfully familiar:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Questioner: What were you up to all summer? Anything useful?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Young naïve undergrad: (always eager to talk about his/her work) Oh yes. I did….blah blah blah (mostly background information on the problem, toned down to the level of the questioner). I showed that (different responses for different fields) [E. coli grows 2% slower than expected on a fructose medium / The set of invertible matrices does look like a flat surface given that you look at it close enough / Similar response for other fields]. 				
				</p>
					
				<p>
					<b>Q: So you spent the entire summer [growing E. coli / looking at matrices]?</b>
				</p>
					
				<p>
					YNU: Essentially, yes. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Q: Are you any closer to [curing cancer / whatever laymen think the ultimate goal of mathematical research is]?</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					YNU: Not really. That really wasn’t what I was working for. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Q: Then you didn’t really do anything worthwhile.</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It is at this point that the questioner, if the questioner is a tax paying citizen of the country, realizes that he/ she funded, in part, a person who used that funding to do “nothing” for three months.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					But the response of the questioner illustrated above is not an irrational response. Normal people don’t fund research out of altruistic tendencies. They fund research because they expect to get something out of it within the near future. That expectation is usually fulfilled in the more applicative disciplines, e.g. Engineering and medicine in particular, and people expect something similar in the pure sciences. In the sciences, a direct forced approach does not always work. Sometimes the necessary tools to solve a problem are yet to be invented, and inventing tools takes time, and is often seen as pointless excursion, and at the very worst, it’s seen as doing science for its own sake.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When confronted with such existential questions about the relevance of their research to the real world, most scientists respond with a series of connections, tenuous at best, starting with their work, and terminating at something that even a layperson would recognize as utilitarian, e.g. making better batteries, curing cancer, etc. The links though, are largely speculative, and there is no real guarantee that things will actually work out as predicted, i.e. the research in question make significant progress towards solving the problem. A lot of scientific work, both today, and in the past has led to (Seemingly? For even now might be too early to judge...) dead ends. Most researchers, after being prodded for a while, admit the possibility of their work being entirely detached from the real world, its raison d’être solely being pure academic curiosity. But does that mean the work is useless? A slightly different question would be is the work useless to the average taxpayer, who is indifferent to scientific nonsense, and only cares about scientific work in terms of the utility it brings to his/her life. The answer in the first case is no, and in the second case, is not really decidable.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Let’s deal with the second question first, i.e. what is research with absolutely no practical applications worth to the average person, one who pays their taxes to fund the research in question. Let’s call such research Useless Research™. Note that the adjective useless in not pejorative in any sense; it merely is shorthand description for the kind of research that does not seemingly hold any value for the taxpayer. Now let’s impose a reasonable, though arbitrary metric on the excellence of a piece of research as the sum of its perceived utility to the taxpayer and the amount of original insight that went into the work. With this metric, it is possible to have excellent Useless Research. Such a piece of work would have to have absolutely no perceived utility, and to compensate for a lack of utility, would need to have astonishingly brilliant insight. Case in point being Cantor’s work on infinite sets (Georg Cantor was a German mathematician, who invented set theory as we know it. He was the first mathematician to deal formally with infinite sets, earlier mathematicians usually leaving the infinities to the philosophers. In his work, he came across several unexpected results, and the unorthodoxy of his methods, led to general skepticism among the broader mathematical community.). Although it contained several brilliant insights, far ahead of the time, the works dealt with infinite sets, which had been dealt in the past only by philosophers, and as such was seen to be useless by not only the laypeople, but also the mathematical community at large. Luckily though, Cantor’s work was redeemed in his lifetime, where the techniques he used in his work (one of them being the famed Diagonal argument), were used more generally, in other areas of mathematics. In the words of David Hilbert, “From his paradise that Cantor with us unfolded, we hold our breath in awe; knowing, we shall not be expelled”.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If there’s a lesson in this, it is that there’s something worthwhile in excellent Useless Research. The brilliant insights, or tricks that form the backbone of excellent Useless Research can be recycled in other contexts, often contexts in which the trick in question might not have been the obvious choice. A lot of progress in mathematics, as well as in other sciences has been made by using an existing trick or technique in a new context. But one needs to keep inventing new tricks, lest one runs out of tricks. And that is what excellent Useless Research does. Since it’s useless, the only way it can be excellent is that it has really astoundingly original trick(s).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					But that still doesn’t answer the original question: how is excellent Useless Research actually useful to the taxpayer? The argument goes something like this: any new trick invented in a particular piece of work can be recycled in a variety of other contexts. One of those contexts might be result in something practical at some point of time. And at that point, our Useless Research has contributed to the real world, becoming Useful Research™ in the process. This argument is made more convincing with an example. Recall the beginning of the essay, where Hardy was quoted as saying number theory has no warlike uses. Now consider a very well known, and seemingly useless to the layperson, ‘trick’ that lets you find integers x and y when given two coprime integers a and b such that ax+by=1. Looks almost cute, but quite useless, most people would be inclined to say. However, there is a very well-known attack on the RSA cryptosystem, known as the common modulus attack, which uses this very trick to decrypt messages if the same message is sent to two different people. Not such a useless trick after all.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					On the other hand, there’s plenty of mathematical research that is still to find some utility in everyday life, even indirectly. It also depends on the amount of time one is willing to wait. Plenty of mathematical research was ahead of its time, and lay dormant until related fields, usually physics caught up to utilise the research in question. Plenty of research thus had to wait several generations before being utilised.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The obvious response of the taxpayer to this answer would be: why should I pay for work I’m not going to benefit from. The answer to that is, since we’re benefitting from research paid for 200 years ago, we owe it to the future generations to pay for the mathematics they’ll need in their time. And that is it: it’s our social responsibility to fund the mathematics our descendants will use.
				</p>

				<p>
					Coming back to the first question now, is any work of research really useless: in absolute terms, not relative to anyone’s perception? The question is rather philosophical in nature, and the answer, by necessity, must also be philosophical. Most people (barring nihilists maybe), are motivated to do what they do by a (often subconscious) desire to achieve some degree of permanence: some record of their existence that lives on after them. There are many different ways people think they achieve permanence. Some people focus on building monuments, some people focus on creating art, and some people focus on raising a family. These different foci have varying degrees of permanence: in the first two cases, the permanence lasts as long as the creation lasts. In the third case, one achieves permanence through one’s descendants. Knowledge creation, on the other hand, does not quite offer permanence in this form. Here, the individual is irrelevant: the knowledge they generate is what matters. People who create knowledge, i.e. researchers, choose to forego the formerly described permanence for something a little different. They choose to add their own small piece of work to the vast edifice that is collective human knowledge. And for each individual, the amount they contribute is different; but that does not matter in the end, because the edifice stays on even after the contributors are gone, irrespective of the size of the contributions. To quote Terence Tao, “Spectacular, deep and remarkable results and insights in this subject... are the hard-won and cumulative achievement of years, decades, or even centuries of steady work and progress of many good and great mathematicians; the advance from one stage of understanding to the next can be highly non-trivial, and sometimes rather unexpected, but still builds upon the foundation of earlier work rather than starting totally anew”.
				</p>
				<p>
					The point of the previous paragraph being that even the most Useless Research is a part of collective human knowledge, and that reason alone, makes it worthwhile to do research for the sake of it.

							Hostel room decoration is seen by many as being frivolous and inane. The very thought of cleaning your own room is sure to send chills down the spine. After all, hostel rooms seem to serve no better purpose than provide a soft bed to rest on during the night and turn into a locker to keep our belongings safe during the day. <a href="quarks/IISc/a-space-of-ones-own.html"><span></span></a>

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
