					Prof. Uday Balakrishnan teaches the third year course, “Intro to Governance”
				</p>
				<h1>When and how were you approached for recruitment into the programme?</h1>
				<p>
					This programme evolved through discussions with Professor Raghavendra Gadagkar and the Dean of the UG programme. It was designed to round off the humanities programmes for UG at IISc. Looking through the areas covered in the humanities programme it was seen that there wasn’t one which talked of how India ran as a country. What were its governance mechanisms, the dynamics of its political, legislative, administrative, electoral and judicial processes? This semester long programme spread over 12-15 classroom sessions was aimed to introduce the students to these, not in a theoretical way, but with inputs from persons with hands on experience in all these areas. Thus we had a former Union Minister telling us how an idea becomes a bill which in turn becomes a law. A former head of RA&W introduced the class to the security challenges India faced and a serving judge of the Supreme Court introduced us to the administration of justice in India.
				</p>
				<h1>What were the most important things that you think a student would have gained from your course?</h1>
				<p>
					The students through their immersive classroom sessions, individual and group assignment would have gained a better appreciation of how such a vast country like India runs.
				</p>
				<h1>What did you like about the students and their response to your course? In what respects do you think the students could have used improvement?</h1>
				<p>
					The response of the students through the three such programmes conducted so far has been amazing. They enthusiastically participated in the classroom sessions, produced incredibly informed group presentations and insightful individual assignment. I think they enjoyed the participative and immersive aspects of the course as well as the opportunity to interact with opinion and policy makers from the highest levels in government. The students willingly stayed on for sessions sometimes lasting more than two hours.
				</p>
				<h1>Were you satisfied with the time allotted to the module? (For example, are there some things that you couldn’t complete because of lack of time?)</h1>
				<p>
					This is an original programme and the only one of its kind in the country. Yes it could have benefitted by having a few more sessions and better scheduling. Ideally I would have liked to cover the dynamics of grassroots democracy with the help of those who actually run Panchayats and more comprehensively cover important aspects the Indian economy and foreign policy. Hopefully this will happen in the next session.
				</p>
				<h1>What is the process behind the choosing of guest lecturers who are called in as part of your course?</h1>
				<p>
					Guest faculty was chosen for its experience, credibility and hands domain knowledge.
				</p>
				<h1>How does your course fit in with the rest of the UG humanities course?</h1>
				<p>Very well indeed in enabling the students to get a more informed understanding of the world we all live in.</p>

				<h1>Is there anything else you would like to add about your experience teaching this module?</h1>
				<p>I would certainly have liked to link a few field trips to build on the classroom sessions – perhaps an opportunity to interact with e.g. the Governor of RBI and his team in RBI, MPs in Parliament and see large social sector schemes on the ground such as MGNREGS.</p>

						Going by my likes and dislikes in general, a city would be an embodiment of everything I am ardently against. They’re chaotic and unruly, and there’s far too much happening for my tiny human brain to keep track of, let alone comprehend. Keeping that in mind, I’ve always wondered why I’m particularly drawn to large cities.<a href="quarks/Non-IISc/viva-la-vida.html"><span></span></a>

							Hostel room decoration is seen by many as being frivolous and inane. The very thought of cleaning your own room is sure to send chills down the spine. After all, hostel rooms seem to serve no better purpose than provide a soft bed to rest on during the night and turn into a locker to keep our belongings safe during the day. <a href="quarks/IISc/a-space-of-ones-own.html"><span></span></a>

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
