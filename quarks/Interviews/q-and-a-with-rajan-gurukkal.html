				<p>Dr. Rajan Gurukkal taught the module “Nature and People” in the third semester Humanities course, “Ways of Doing”.
</p>
<h1>How and when did you join CCS (Centre for Contemporary Studies), and where did you work before? What courses did you teach there?
</h1>
				<p>
					I was Professor & Director, School of Social Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, Kerala State before joining CCS. A historian by training eventually moved on to social theory, historical human ecology, human geography, philosophy of science, and finally history of knowledge production, the Courses I taught were mainly in social theory and human
ecology. I became an invited Professor at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociale, Paris 2006 where I taught methodological aspects of early Indian knowledge production. I was invited to CCS as Soundararajan Chair Visiting Professor in 2008. On nomination as Vice Chancellor in my former university for a term (2008 – 2012) I lefy CCS. Invited to the CCS Chair again in 2012, I have been here teaching philosophy of science and the UG Course in ‘Nature and People.

				</p>
<h1>Why do you think CCS is smaller than the humanities departments in other colleges, do you think there is scope for expansion? What are your views on the no permanent faculty policy of CCS?
</h1>
				<p>
					Yes, structurally CCS is smaller than the Department of Humanities/Social Sciences in other universities or IITs. But functionally it is quite bigger. Having not entrenched as a regular Department of teaching and research with permanent faculty it has the advantage of serving
as a platform for the convergence of umpteen fields. It deals with the contemporary issues relating to human aﬀairs – intellectual, socio-economic and politico-cultural. Of course, it has enormous scope for expansion but never to be falling in line with the conventional and becoming sterile with a few permanent faculty members in certain disciplines. Themes of CCS do not belong to any of the established disciplines. They are interdisciplinary. CCS is a convergence centre of interdisciplinary knowledge dissemination. It hardly treads along the entrenched path, but it treads and that becomes the path.

				</p>

<h1>You have been associated with CCS for the past 4 years, have you noticed any changes in CCS and UG?
</h1>
				<p>
					I have been with CCS only for the past four years. A theme that it has been probing was ‘knowledge production.’ I had delivered several lectures in the subject as part of a Course in the theme, first in 2008 and subsequently during 2014, 2015 and 2016. In 2014 the Course focused on early Indian knowledge production. In 2015 CCS organised a National Seminar on methodological aspects of knowledge production in early India. I have noticed
two remarkable changes about the working of CCS: 1) the lead role that it started playing in the designing and implementation of the humanities/social sciences courses for UG students, and 2) the publication of the articles presented in the CCS decennial National Seminar on ‘Knowledge Production in Pre-colonial India: Methodological Aspects,’ as a special issue of the Journal of History of Science (Vol.51, No.1, 2016) of INSA. It is an attempt at responding to the entrenched belief that knowledge production in traditional India lacked any methodology in the Western sense, for the scholars were considered as sages of deep introspection and extra-sensory perception. The articles address the question of methodology from the knowledge base of various domains like ancient metallurgy, healthcare,
mathematics, logic, philosophy, grammar, architecture, intellectual history, histrionics and musicology lay bare the fact that knowledge production in traditional India had followed universally valid epistemological properties that Europe ordained only since Scientific Revolution.

<h1>In your opinion what is the relevance of humanities in today’s world?</h1>
				<p>
Quality transmission of knowledge with criticality is the purpose of humanities courses. Learning sciences, social sciences and humanities has become an alienating and deskilling exercise in the country, for the learner gets lost in the descriptive literature on one aspect or the other of the discipline of choice. Sources of knowledge and modes of knowing remain compartmentalized, stereotypical and rigid allowing the learner little or no ﬂexibility in acquiring knowledge about anything without its being segregated into independent facets. This is all the more true of science and technology education, for its being almost entirely
subsumed by technicality divesting the learner of the faculty to relate the knowledge/skill to human aﬀairs and social processes. ‘Quality’ in transmission implies the student’s utilization of the transmitted knowledge in the development of higher cognitive ability, sharper analytical faculty and better language power with a thorough knowledge about the fundamentals of the discipline concerned. ‘Quality’ knowledge in any discipline is deep, theoretical, scientific and invariably subversive because it exposes the surface information that is shallow
and shoddy as distinguished from the profoundly buried deeper truth. It is this embedded transformational potential of learning that is called the politics of knowledge. Quality higher education is one that renders possible the eﬀective transmission of socially useful knowledge that can act as critical consciousness enabling the youth to emerge as responsible citizens and creatively engage in public policy debates. IISc’s positioning itself as a seat of highly specialized scientific knowledge of discipline based divergence, distanced from the common
people as in the case of any University, is by and large based on the conventional, tacit and linear perspective of science education. It is important to facilitate convergence teaching/learning at the instance of social issues/problems, which provides critical insights enabling the learner to be conscious of the need for combining economic growth with equity and surplus productivity with resource sustainability. Convergence of sciences with this critical social agenda leads to the holistic integration of specialized knowledge diﬀused in multiple disciplines, a process to be identified as real interdisciplinary pedagogic movement. Over the past few decades several non-conventional areas of knowledge cutting across physical, natural and social sciences have emerged as a result of researches beyond disciplinary boundaries, thus letting disciplines move closer to one another. Humanities and social sciences are knowledge areas that engender interdisciplinarity and criticality, a perspective of extreme importance to the world today.


				</p>
<h1>What are the challenges of teaching humanities to a scientific audience?</h1>
				<p>
					The main challenge is putting across the political economy of the techno-capitalist world for the students acquiring science/technology as neutral knowledge, who are least initiated in critical thoughts.

						Going by my likes and dislikes in general, a city would be an embodiment of everything I am ardently against. They’re chaotic and unruly, and there’s far too much happening for my tiny human brain to keep track of, let alone comprehend. Keeping that in mind, I’ve always wondered why I’m particularly drawn to large cities.<a href="quarks/Non-IISc/viva-la-vida.html"><span></span></a>

							Hostel room decoration is seen by many as being frivolous and inane. The very thought of cleaning your own room is sure to send chills down the spine. After all, hostel rooms seem to serve no better purpose than provide a soft bed to rest on during the night and turn into a locker to keep our belongings safe during the day. <a href="quarks/IISc/a-space-of-ones-own.html"><span></span></a>

							Pravega, the IISc undergrad festival, has been a presence in the undergrads’ calendar since its inception in 2014. And not unlike other colleges, a lot of IISc undergrads have amalgamated the idea of Pravega as part of their identity. When people internalize a foreign notion as part of their identity, they often fail to see the notion objectively and make unbiased judgements and decisions regarding that notion. Furthermore, they take valid criticisms about the notion to be criticisms of their identity, which is exactly the wrong way to go about it.<a href="quarks/IISc/pravega-2015-stating-the-obvious.html"><span></span></a>
